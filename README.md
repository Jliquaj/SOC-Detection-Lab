# SOC DETECTION LAB

## Objective

The SOC Detection Lab project was created to simulate real-world cyber threat detection within a controlled environment. The primary objective was to ingest and analyze Apache access logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (Splunk), in order to detect signs of brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, and reconnaissance behavior. 
### Skills Learned


- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting Apache access logs to identify suspicious patterns and potential threats.
- Strong understanding of HTTP status codes and their significance in identifying malicious behavior.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Built and executed queries to investigate attack signatures and uncover trends in failed login attempts or unauthorized access.
- Practiced documenting threats clearly with screenshots, search queries, and written explanations of what was observed.

### Tools Used

- SPLUNK
- Apache Access Logs
